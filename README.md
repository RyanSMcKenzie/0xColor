# 0xColor
A color swatching app for web developers

0xColor is a color swatching app designed for web developers to select specific 255pt colors and retreive the 
appropriate hexadecimal code to display this color.

1) 255pt RGB Sliders to fine-tune your color
2) A dynamic background to visualize your color in real time
3) A hexadecimal conversion to convert any color to its appropriate display value
4) Core Data saving and deleting of colors, so you can keep your colors for later use, and delete them when you're done
5) Actively select a color from your saved colors to retouch it, if you want a different, but similar color
